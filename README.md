# Converter-React-Native
 App React Native : Currency converter (KRW -> EUR)

Important technical features:

* Currency changeover: KRW -> EUR & EUR -> KRW in 1 click
* Daily API call for the most accurate conversion possible
* Automatic display of the date and time of the last successful update.
* Visual indicators: a Wi-Fi icon for successful API updates, and another for failed calls (if the call fails, the application will take the default value until the next call).

Modify the API in "components/useApi.js" to make the application more reliable
